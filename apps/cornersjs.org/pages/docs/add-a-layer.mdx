# Add a layer

In the examples we've seen so far with presets, we have not played around with borders yet. Borders and drop-shadows present us with special problems on the DOM. That's because `corners` uses an SVG clipping-path on the DOM object that you give it. If you associate `corners` with a `div` element, for example, the clipping-path acts as a mask on that `div`, and cuts out part of that div to render the `div` the way you want it.

However, if the `div` has a border on it, it will look wrong. Let's take a simple example of this:

<ProblematicUseOfCssBorder />
<ProblematicUseOfCssBorderCode />

You can see in this example, the `<button>` that was rendered is missing parts of its border. So how do we fix this? We need to add a **layer** to our object.

## Let's add a layer

A `layer` is an SVG that is rendered in addition to the DOM element that you provide the `corners` library when you invoke it. You have already seen the `cornerSize` attribute when invoking an object with corners. In addition to this, you can also add an `above` property. This will add an SVG to your DOM element "above" it, and this is the tool that you'll use to generate a proper border on your object.

Here is a properly-implemented rounded button with a border that renders without being masked out.

<SuccessfulUseOfLayerStroke />
<SuccessfulUseOfLayerStrokeCode />
