# Clipping

The way `corners` works, by default, is to "clip" or "mask" the DOM element that you provide it, but as you become more advanced with using `corners`, you will likely decide that these training-wheels are getting in your way. You can create very advanced shapes with corners, if you really use it to its fullest extent!

Let's start by turning off clipping. We'll do this by providing the property `useClipPath: false` to `corners` when we create a component with it, as follows:

<IncorrectUnclippedRoundedButton />
<IncorrectUnclippedRoundedButtonCode />

As you can see, the background color of the button "leaks" out of the button now, causing it to look awful. The `useClipPath` (which defaults to `true`) had your back on this one, but now that you've decided to turn it off, you're on your own for figuring out the background. But there's a solution!

## Adding a layer **below** your DOM element

`corners` can deal with this problem quite elegantly by giving you the opportunity to provide an additional layer **below** your DOM element. To accomplish this, we're going remove the `background` of the original DOM element (meaning, we need to set it `transparent`, because buttons have a default `background-color`). Next, we're going to add a new layer `below`, as follows:

<UnclippedRoundedButtonCode />

And that gives us the following:

<UnclippedRoundedButton>Cool unclipped button</UnclippedRoundedButton>

And now you can see that we have gotten our background back.
