# Pre-sets

Corners provides you with the ability to make exotic shapes and associate them with DOM elements on your page. Out of the box, Corners has a number of pre-defined shapes that you can grab and use immediately. These pre-defined shapes are called "pre-sets". Let's take a look at a few of them now.

## `chamfered`

The `chamfered` preset is a rectangle with two opposite corners cleaved off, like this:

<ChamferedDivWithStroke>chamfered, stroke layer below</ChamferedDivWithStroke>

{/* <ChamferedDivWithStrokeCode /> */}
